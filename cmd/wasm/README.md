# docker-agent in the browser (js/wasm)

`cmd/wasm` is a `GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm` entry point that exposes a thin slice
of docker-agent — config parsing and a single-round streaming chat — to a
JavaScript host (a browser tab or Node).

It is **not** a port of the full agent. It is a proof-of-concept for the
"realistic plan" outlined when we surveyed which parts of docker-agent could
even be cross-compiled to wasm. See the *Limits* section below.

## Build

```sh
# Compile.
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o cmd/wasm/web/docker-agent.wasm ./cmd/wasm

# Copy the matching wasm_exec.js shim from the Go toolchain (its API is
# tied to the compiler version and must match the binary).
cp "$(go env GOROOT)/lib/wasm/wasm_exec.js" cmd/wasm/web/wasm_exec.js
```

The output is a ~75 MB `.wasm`. It includes the entire YAML parser, three LLM
provider clients (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) and their dependencies. With
`tinygo` or `-ldflags="-s -w"` plus `wasm-opt` you can roughly halve it; we
have not optimised the size.

## Run (Node smoke test)

```sh
node cmd/wasm/smoke_test.js
```

Prints the parsed config of a small two-agent YAML and exits 0. This proves
that the Go runtime starts under wasm, that `globalThis.dockerAgent` gets
registered, and that `parseConfig` returns the expected shape.

## Run (browser, with OpenRouter sign-in)

The demo page implements OpenRouter's [PKCE OAuth flow](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/oauth-pkce):

1. Serve `cmd/wasm/web/` over HTTP (`WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming`
   needs the `application/wasm` MIME type, so `file://` won't work):

   ```sh
   cd cmd/wasm/web && python3 -m http.server 8765
   ```

2. Open <http://localhost:8765/>.

3. Click **Sign in with OpenRouter** — you'll be redirected to
   `openrouter.ai`, log in, approve the app, and bounced back. The page
   exchanges the `?code=` for a user-controlled API key (PKCE / S256) and
   stores it in `localStorage`.

4. Pick a free model from the dropdown (the YAML textarea updates
   automatically) and click **Run**. Streaming completion deltas appear in
   the output box.

5. To revoke the key: click **Sign out** in the page (clears local copy)
   and/or visit
   <https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys> to revoke server-side.

### Why this works in a browser

Most LLM providers block direct browser fetches because anyone could read
the API key out of the Network tab. OpenRouter solves this by issuing
*per-app, per-user* keys via PKCE — the user owns the key, can revoke it,
and the app never sees a master credential.

We verified the relevant CORS posture before shipping:

```
$ curl -is -X OPTIONS https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/auth/keys \
    -H "Origin: http://localhost:8765" \
    -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST"
HTTP/2 204
access-control-allow-origin: *
access-control-allow-headers: Authorization,...,Content-Type,...
```

Both `/api/v1/auth/keys` (token exchange) and `/api/v1/chat/completions`
(inference) return `access-control-allow-origin: *` with `Authorization`
in the allowed headers. No proxy needed.

### What the YAML looks like

OpenRouter exposes an OpenAI-compatible API, so it slots in as a custom
provider:

```yaml
providers:
  openrouter:
    provider: openai
    base_url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
    token_key: OPENROUTER_API_KEY
agents:
  root:
    model: openrouter/meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free
    instruction: |
      You are a helpful assistant ...
```

When the user clicks **Run**, the page passes the stored key as
`env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to `dockerAgent.chat(...)`, the existing
`pkg/model/provider/openai` reads it via `env.Get(ctx, cfg.TokenKey)`, and
the Go HTTP transport (mapped to `fetch` under js/wasm) sends the
request. **Same code path the CLI uses** — no special browser-only branch.

### Bring-your-own-key fallback

The `<details>` block on the page lets advanced users paste OpenAI /
Anthropic / Gemini keys directly. Anthropic recently added
`anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access` so it actually works from a
tab; OpenAI and Gemini still block CORS for browser origins, so those
fields are mostly there for use against a self-hosted proxy.

## JavaScript API

Once the wasm boots, two functions are exported on `globalThis.dockerAgent`:

### `parseConfig(yamlString) -> object`

Synchronous. Loads the YAML through `pkg/config.Load` (so all the version
upgraders run) and returns a small JS-shaped projection:

```js
dockerAgent.parseConfig(`
version: "2"
agents:
  root:
    model: openai/gpt-4o-mini
    instruction: hi
`);
// =>
// {
//   version: "2",
//   agents: [{ name: "root", model: "openai/gpt-4o-mini", instruction: "hi", ... }],
//   models: { "openai/gpt-4o-mini": { provider: "openai", model: "gpt-4o-mini" } }
// }
```

Throws a JS `Error` on invalid YAML / unsupported version / failed validation.

### `chat({yaml, agentName?, env?, messages}, onEvent) -> Promise`

Asynchronous. Loads the config, picks the agent (or the only one), builds
its model provider, and opens one streaming chat completion.

- `yaml` — the YAML document, same as for `parseConfig`.
- `agentName` — required if the config defines more than one agent.
- `env` — `{ OPENAI_API_KEY: "...", ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: "...", GEMINI_API_KEY: "..." }`.
  Whatever your model needs.
- `messages` — array of `{role, content}` objects, OpenAI-style. The agent's
  `instruction` is automatically prepended as a `system` message if you
  haven't already supplied one.
- `onEvent(ev)` — called from Go for every stream event:
  - `{type: "delta",  content?: string, reasoning?: string}`
  - `{type: "finish", reason: string}`

Resolves to `{message: {role, content, reasoning, finish}}` once the stream
ends. Rejects with an `Error` on any failure.

## Limits

These are not bugs to fix; they are direct consequences of `GOOS=js`:

- **No tools, no MCP, no hooks, no sub-agent handoffs.** Anything that needs
  `os/exec` or local file I/O is excluded from the build.
- **No browser-local durable sessions.** The demo caller keeps its own message
  history. Native runtime sqlite cannot be linked into this build; HTTP authority
  mode below instead uses portable session contracts and server-owned persistence.
- **Explicit provider selection.** The demo registers OpenAI, Anthropic and
  Google in `providers.go`. The shared core provider registry is empty on
  every platform; embedders register only the implementations they need.
- **No Docker Model Runner, no Bedrock, no Vertex AI.** Same reason —
  `dmr` shells out, `bedrock` and `vertexai` pull in cloud SDKs that don't
  cross-compile to wasm.
- **No Docker Desktop integration.** `pkg/desktop` has stubs for js that
  return empty paths and refuse to dial.
- **CORS.** Mentioned above. Real deployment needs a proxy.

## Where the cross-compilation work lives

The shims that make the existing tree compile under `GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm`
are intentionally tiny:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pkg/cache/lock_js.go` | No-op file-lock stubs (single-threaded js). |
| `pkg/userconfig/lock_js.go` | No-op file-lock stubs for the user config file (single-threaded js). |
| `pkg/desktop/sockets_js.go` | Returns empty Docker Desktop paths. |
| `pkg/desktop/connection_js.go` | Refuses Unix-socket / named-pipe dials. |
| `pkg/desktop/connection_other.go` | Build tag updated to `!windows && !js`. |
| `cmd/wasm/providers.go` | Explicit demo provider registry (OpenAI / Anthropic / Google). |

Everything else compiles unchanged because docker-agent already had the
`os/exec`, sandbox, sound, audio, server, browser, keyring code well-isolated
behind their own packages — the wasm entry just doesn't import them.

## Embedding with fewer providers

`pkg/model/provider` shares its registry implementation between native and
js/wasm builds and imports no concrete SDK-backed providers. Its
`DefaultRegistry()` is empty: code that previously relied on the WASM defaults
must now pass an explicit registry. The demo retains its provider set through
`demoProviders`; a smaller application can register just Anthropic:

```go
registry := provider.NewRegistry(map[string]provider.Factory{
    "anthropic": func(ctx context.Context, cfg *latest.ModelConfig,
        env environment.Provider, opts ...options.Opt) (provider.Provider, error) {
        return anthropic.NewClient(ctx, cfg, env, opts...)
    },
})
```

Pass it to `teamloader.WithProviderRegistry(registry)` when loading YAML and
`runtime.WithProviderRegistry(registry)` when constructing a local runtime, so
runtime model switching uses the same provider set. Register toolsets separately
and use `teamloader.WithStrict()` to reject unsupported configuration features.
Do not import `pkg/teamloader/defaults` or `pkg/model/provider/providers` in a
restricted bootstrap: those deliberately wire the full implementations.

This changes dependency wiring, not config-version support, schemas, or MCP.

## Sanity check

```sh
# Native build still happy.
go build ./...

# Wasm build still happy.
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o /tmp/cagent.wasm ./cmd/wasm

# Existing tests of the touched packages still pass.
go test ./pkg/cache/... ./pkg/desktop/... ./pkg/model/provider/...

# Provider registration and wire behavior under Node's Go/WASM runner.
task test-wasm-providers

# End-to-end runtime smoke test.
node cmd/wasm/smoke_test.js
```

## Common-authority HTTP mode

`connectAuthority` is a transport-only alternative to `chat`: it never loads a
browser-local team or runs the simplified demo loop. The API server owns session
execution, persistence, tools, interactions, and cancellation. Serve the page
from the same origin (or configure an authenticated reverse proxy with appropriate
CORS); a browser cannot connect directly to the board's Unix socket. Do not expose
an unauthenticated API to the network or store bearer tokens in localStorage.

```js
const authority = dockerAgent.connectAuthority({url: "https://agent.example", token});
const session = await authority.create({source: "team.yaml", agent_name: "root"});
const id = session.session_id;
const snapshot = await authority.attach(id);
const subscription = authority.observe(id, message => {
  // snapshot replaces the presentation baseline, including outstanding prompts.
  // event.envelope carries epoch, sequence, turn_id and interaction_id.
  // On a gap, discard the stale tail, close, re-attach and observe again.
  console.log(message);
});
const accepted = await authority.submit(id, {content: "Inspect this project", request_id: crypto.randomUUID()});
// Respond using the exact interaction identity from snapshot.interactions or an envelope:
await authority.respond(id, {interaction_id, kind: "confirmation", confirmation: "approve"});
await authority.wait(id, accepted.turn_id); // exact durable turn settlement
subscription.close(); // detaches observation, NEVER cancels execution
await subscription.done;
```

Reconnect with `observe(id, callback, {since: cursor, epoch})`. An epoch mismatch
produces a fresh snapshot baseline; chunked snapshots are assembled before the
callback. A disconnect rejects `subscription.done` so the host can reconnect;
there is no automatic retry of mutations or interaction answers. Save both epoch
and sequence, not sequence alone. `cancel(id, turnID)` cancels an exact turn;
`stopSubtree(id)` uses the advertised stop-subtree capability and must not be
substituted for cancellation on servers lacking it. `disconnect()` closes this
client's observations without stopping sessions. `request(method, relativePath,
body)` exposes the remaining canonical v2 surface (tools, permissions, branches,
model changes, todos, pause, editing, and deletion) without maintaining a second
browser-specific execution model. Server errors reject promises. CRUD requests have a 30-second timeout; use the
caller-visible timeout as an unknown mutation outcome, not permission to retry
without the original request identity. `disconnect()` also cancels pending
requests and permanently closes this authority connection. Observation validates
wire version, session identity, epoch, sequence and chunk cursors; a gap is
delivered once and terminates that subscription before any stale tail.

The existing `chat({yaml, env, messages}, callback)` and `abort()` remain the
**legacy local demo boundary**. They do not attach to daemon sessions and must not
be presented as equivalent session authority. `pkg/api/session.go` supplies the
portable HTTP contracts; this mode does not import native `pkg/runtime` or sqlite.
